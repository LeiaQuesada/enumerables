# Ruby Enumerables Practice!
#### "We numer-rabble now!"

Does iteration make your skin crawl?

Do you need practice with a certain enumerable?

Well c'mon down and face your fears! Write tests for your fellow students. Learn in the process!

**Synopsis**: Pass these tests and practice enumerables. Progress in your knowledge.

Make your own tests with other enumerables. Progress in your knowledge.

Make commits to this project. Progress in your knowledge.

Others clone and learn from your tests. They make their own tests and make commits *ad nausea*!

**Why do this?**
The best way to learn is to teach. And while you're learning you can contribute to a better world by helping others to grow and be empowered to learn an important and in-demand skill. That's a great thing thing to be a part of.  

## Installation
1) `git clone` this project.
2) Using your terminal, `cd` into the `enumerables/test` directory of this project
3) Using your terminal, run `ruby any_test.rb` or `ruby name_of_test.rb`. Unskip tests by either commenting out the `skip` command or deleting `skip` entirely. 
4) Try to pass all the tests!


#### This is an open source project.
 I've started with the `find_all` enumerable. I'll continue adding to this, or maybe I won't. No promises. Only a start and hope that maybe this will help someone.

 Cheers!
